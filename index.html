    <h1 class="header">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>
         were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly<br>
          feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
          <p class="parag">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
             I’ve been looking to make a <br>transition and have heard some people 
             who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br> the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
               The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
                Since completing the course, I’ve<br> successfully switched careers,
             working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <p class="parag">“ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. 
            I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”</p>

        <h1 class="headerw">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
        <p class="parag">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who
             can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
              wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never 
              had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in
               a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
               experience. It certainly helped
             me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>

        <h1 class="header">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from 
            their experiences was easy.</h1>
        <p class="parag">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary 
            to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
             You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
